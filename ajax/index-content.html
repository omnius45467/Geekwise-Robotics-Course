                <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
                <li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
                <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li>
