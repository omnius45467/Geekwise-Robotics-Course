        <h2>We need to find a way to add hardware to the robot.</h2>
        <p>Here is a simple walk-through.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Look at the item you wish to integrate, try to find any markings that might indicate a serial number or a manufacturing number. </li>
            <li>Once you have that, try and find the item online through google</li>
            <li>Most likely the part you are wanting to use might be common, and so they might have power specs online or a diagram of the device. Try and follow what other people have done in the past.</li>
            <li>Next find the group wire. It should be a black or brown wire. Usually if it is a DC motor both wires can act as the ground.</li>
            <li>After that find a wire that might be a power supply. You will want to connect the robot power supply to the hardware you want to integrate</li>
        </ul>
